# Predicting-Customer-Churn
A common problem across businesses in many industries is that of customer churn. Businesses often have to invest substantial amounts attracting new clients, so every time a client leaves it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort then need to be channelled into replacing them. Being able to predict when a client is likely to leave and offer them incentives to stay can offer huge savings to a business. This is the essence of customer churn prediction; how can we quantify if and when a customer is likely to churn?
